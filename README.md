# RockPaperScissors

A simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game played in a browser.
Logic made in javascript, bones made in html and css.
The game now has a hard mode which uses the players previous choices to choose the computer's next move. The site tracks the player's choices from the first move using session storage so it persists through page reloads, but not page closures.
